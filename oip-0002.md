## Abstract

This proposal introduces an extension to the REChain consensus protocol, enabling nodes to reach consensus on the current timestamp. This consensus timestamp can be utilized by smart contracts, eliminating the need for reliance on oracles.

## Motivation

Timestamps are integral to the functionality of most smart contracts. For instance, a contract may specify that an address can be accessed by a party after a specific future date and time. Currently, the REChain protocol does not include a native timestamp, forcing contracts to depend on external timestamp oracles. While suitable for short-term or low-stakes contracts, oracles introduce a single point of failure. This proposal seeks to mitigate this issue by embedding timestamp functionality directly into the REChain protocol.

## Specification

1. **Timestamp Inclusion**: Each block will now include an additional field: timestamp, representing the number of seconds since the epoch (UTC). 
2. **Block Hash Modification**: The block hash will incorporate the timestamp. Blocks using this update will have a version number `2.0`, while those using the previous method will remain at version `1.0`.
3. **Upgrade Path**: All blocks created after a specific milestone block index (MCI) will require version `2.0`, while previous blocks will maintain version `1.0`.
4. **Smart Contract Integration**: The smart contract language will support a new clause such as `["timestamp", [">", 1550768343]]`, allowing timestamp-based conditions.
5. **Timestamp Ordering**: Each block's timestamp must be greater than or equal to that of its parent block(s).
6. **Timestamp Verification**:
   a. **Minor Future Timestamps**: If a node receives a block with a timestamp marginally in the future (e.g., up to 10 minutes, configurable), it will accept the block but will not reference it as a parent until the timestamp becomes current.
   b. **Significant Future Timestamps**: Blocks with timestamps too far in the future will be temporarily rejected, pending later validation.

## Rationale

REChain operates without a built-in timestamp in its consensus protocol, unlike many Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, which require timestamps for functions like block difficulty adjustment and scheduling. This lack of a protocol-level timestamp has driven the reliance on external oracles for smart contractsâ€”a reliance that this proposal aims to remove.

The new timestamp consensus mechanism is designed to align closely with existing blockchain protocols that incorporate timestamps, ensuring minimal disruption to the network's core functionalities. The proposed system is expected to produce timestamps that are accurate within a few seconds, without introducing vulnerabilities such as time-warp attacks.

The incentive structure of REChain nodes, similar to that of miners in PoW systems, discourages the use of inaccurate timestamps. Nodes are motivated to adopt the most recent blocks as parents to maximize their chances of earning rewards, which naturally promotes the use of accurate timestamps.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal introduces a breaking change, requiring all nodes to upgrade to the new protocol before the designated upgrade MCI. The transition plan ensures that old blocks remain valid while allowing the network to shift seamlessly to the new system.
