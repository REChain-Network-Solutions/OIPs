## Abstract

This proposal introduces an extension to the REChain consensus protocol that facilitates the burning of REChain tokens. It establishes a standardized method for provably burning tokens, which can be utilized by sidechains integrated with REChain.

## Motivation

Certain applications may require a provable mechanism for burning REChain tokens as a form of competition or to achieve specific goals. This proposal addresses the need for a standardized approach to token burning.

The primary focus is on sidechains. Sidechains that operate as blockchains can leverage REChain’s ordering capabilities to sequence their blocks, bypassing their native consensus mechanisms, which are often centralized and prone to censorship. These blockchains, whether based on technologies like EVM or Solana, can post the full content of their blocks to REChain as `temp_data` ([OIP 7](oip-0007.md)). In cases of block forks, resolution can be achieved by comparing the blocks’ relative order on the REChain DAG and the amount of tokens burned by the block producers. The block posted within a designated timeframe and with the highest burn amount will be considered valid.

Currently, tokens can be burned by sending them to non-spendable addresses, but this method lacks clarity and consistency. A standardized burning method would simplify and unify the process.

## Specification

1. **Burn Fee Field**: Introduce an optional `burn_fee` field in the unit JSON:
    ```json
    "burn_fee": 12345
    ```
    The unit must account for the `burn_fee`, as follows:
    ```
    (sum of all inputs in tokens) = (sum of all outputs in tokens) + (standard size-based fees) + oversize_fee + tps_fee + burn_fee + (other fees)
    ```

2. **Default Fee**: If the `burn_fee` is not specified, it is assumed to be 0.

3. **AA Restrictions**: Autonomous Agents (AAs) are prohibited from paying the burn fee.

4. **Upgrade Compliance**: These rules apply to units with a last ball MCI after a specified upgrade MCI, set to allow sufficient time for node upgrades.

## Rationale

The proposed change allows sidechain block producers to compete for block production rights by posting their proposed blocks to REChain as `temp_data` and simultaneously burning REChain tokens. The block that burns the most tokens, within a valid timeframe, will be selected (assuming it meets all other validation criteria).

This mechanism benefits token holders by creating demand for token burning, thus reducing the circulating supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal introduces a breaking change. All nodes must upgrade before the specified upgrade MCI as detailed in rule 4.
