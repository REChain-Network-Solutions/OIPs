REChain Improvement Proposals

Individuals wishing to submit REChain Improvement Proposals (OIPs) should first discuss their idea or document on the [Katya ® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain ®️ 🪐 Blockchain Node Network](https://matrix.to/#/#chatting:matrix.katya.wtf). Following the discussion, they should create a pull request to this repository with the proposed OIP. After copy-editing and acceptance, the proposal will be published here.

We adopt a relatively liberal approach to approving OIPs and strive to minimize our involvement in decision-making on behalf of the community. In rare cases where disputes arise and consensus cannot be reached, we will favor the conservative option.

An OIP listed here is not considered a formally accepted standard until its status is marked as Final or Active.
