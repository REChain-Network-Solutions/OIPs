## Abstract

This proposal introduces an extension to the REChain consensus protocol, allowing for temporary data storage on the DAG. Data will be stored temporarily for a default period of 1 day, after which it can be removed, though a hash of the data will remain on the DAG indefinitely. This method avoids the oversize fee outlined in [OIP 5](oip-0005.md) and incurs only half of the standard payload fee.

## Motivation

Applications may require revealing and timestamping large amounts of data. The oversize fee in [OIP 5](oip-0005.md) could make such use cases impractical. 

The primary target for this proposal is sidechains. Sidechains that use REChain for block ordering instead of their own consensus mechanisms can benefit significantly. They can use REChain to order blocks, resolving forks by leveraging the block's position on the DAG and additional criteria like burn fees from [OIP 8](oip-0008.md). Storing block data long-term on the sidechain would not be necessary, and revealing block data when posting it ensures transparency and validity.

## Specification

1. **New App Type**: Introduce a new `app` type `temp_data`. Its payload must be inline and follow this format:
    ```json
    "payload": {
        "data_length": 12345,
        "data_hash": "base64 hash of data",
        "data": actual data
    }
    ```
    Here, `data_length` is the size of the `data` object, and `data_hash` is its hash. Lengths and hashes are calculated as per existing REChain methods.

2. **Data Removal**: Nodes can omit the `data` field and remove it from their database after at least 1 day from the unitâ€™s timestamp.

3. **Validation**: A unit containing `temp_data` should be temporarily rejected if it lacks the `data` field and the timestamp is less than 1 day old. The unit will be accepted once the 1-day period has passed.

4. **Size Calculation**: When calculating the unit's size for oversize fee purposes, exclude the `data` field of `temp_data`. Include the `data_length` and `data_hash` fields.

5. **Payload Size Calculation**: For payload size calculations, remove the `data` fields (if any), calculate the length of the remaining payload, and add `(data_length + 4) / 2` (4 is the length of the "data" field name).

6. **AA Transactions**: AAs can send `temp_data` just like any other address.

7. **Multiple Temp Data**: Allow multiple `temp_data` entries per unit.

8. **Upgrade Application**: These rules apply to units whose last ball MCI is after a specified upgrade MCI, allowing time for nodes to upgrade.

## Rationale

The proposed change enables the temporary storage of large data on REChain without imposing a permanent storage burden on nodes. It requires that data be revealed during posting, which aligns with the needs of sidechains.

Nodes will only need to store additional data for 1 day, reducing the impact on storage. Exempting `temp_data` from the oversize fee prevents potential spamming issues, while charging half the regular rate for `temp_data` encourages the use of this method for smaller data.

The 1-day retention period is deemed adequate for sidechain forks resolution. Temporary rejection based on node clock discrepancies is acceptable due to the nature of temporary rejection.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is a breaking change, requiring all nodes to upgrade before the specified upgrade MCI.
