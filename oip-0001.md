## Abstract

A REChain Improvement Proposal (RECH) is a design document providing information to the REChain community or describing a new feature for REChain or its processes or environment. The RECH should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend RECHs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into REChain. The RECH author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the RECHs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

## RECH workflow

The RECH process begins with a new idea for REChain. Each potential RECH must have a champion -- someone who writes the RECH using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The RECH champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is RECH-able.
Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often don't require standardization between multiple projects; these don't need a RECH and should be injected into the relevant project-specific development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue tracker.
Additionally, many ideas have been brought forward for changing REChain that have been rejected for various reasons.
The first step should be to search past discussions to see if an idea has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its progression.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a RECH is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time.
Asking the REChain community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick).
It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where REChain is used.

This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft RECH to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal.
Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the [RECHs git repository](https://github.com/REChain-Network-Solutions) as a pull request.
This draft must be written in RECH style as described below and named with an alias such as "RECH-johndoe-infinitebytes" until the editor has assigned it a RECH number (authors MUST NOT self-assign RECH numbers).

It is highly recommended that a single RECH contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the RECH, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your RECH into several well-focused ones.

When the RECH draft is complete, the RECH editor will assign the RECH a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, and merge the pull request to the RECHs git repository.
The RECH editor will not unreasonably reject a RECH.
Reasons for rejecting RECHs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not in keeping with the REChain philosophy.
For a RECH to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The RECH author may update the draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

### Transferring RECH Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of RECHs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred RECH, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the RECH process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the RECH. We try to build consensus around a RECH, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing RECH.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a RECH, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the RECH editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the RECH editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

### RECH Editors

The current RECH editor is Tony Churyumoff who can be contacted at [REChain dEX E-Mail](mailto:pr@rechain.email)

### RECH Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

For each new RECH that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the RECH to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) must be addressed.
* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification.
* Licensing terms must be acceptable for RECHs.

If the RECH isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the RECH is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull request" to the [RECHs git repository](https://github.com/REChain-Network-Solutions) where it may get further feedback.

The RECH editor will:

* Assign a RECH number in the pull request.

* Merge the pull request when it is ready.

* List the RECH in [README.md](README.md)

The RECH editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The RECH editors monitor RECH changes, and update RECH headers as appropriate.

## RECH format and structure

### Specification

RECHs should be written in Markdown format.

Each RECH should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the RECH ([see below](#RECH-header-preamble)).

* Abstract -- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

* Copyright -- The RECH must be explicitly licensed under acceptable copyright terms ([see below](#RECH-licensing)).

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for RECHs that want to change the REChain protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the RECH solves. RECH submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

* Backwards Compatibility -- All RECHs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The RECH must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. RECH submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

* Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any RECH is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the RECH is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. However, the RECH should not be "Final" until there is at least one reference implementation. The final implementation must include test code and documentation.

#### RECH Header Preamble

Each RECH must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and should be omitted if empty.

RECH: <RECH number, or "?" before assignment>
Title: <RECH title; maximum 44 characters>

Discussions-To: <email address or URL>
Comments-Summary: <summary tone>
Comments-URI: <links to wiki page for comments>
Status: <Draft | Proposed | Active | Deferred | Rejected | Withdrawn | Final | Replaced | Obsolete>
Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
License: <abbreviation for approved license(s)>


The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the RECH. The format of the Author header value must be "Author Name <email@example.com>". If the email address is included, and the domain part is for a mail list, that mail list must be archived and the archive URL pointer included in the Discussion-To header.

The RECH should have a coherent title. It should avoid acronyms or abbreviations that aren't well established.

#### Auxiliary Files

RECHs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Auxiliary files must be named RECH-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the RECH number and "Y" is a serial number starting at 1.

### RECH types

There are three types of RECH:

* **Standards Track RECH** -- Describes any change that affects most or all REChain implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using REChain. Furthermore, we require that all Standards Track RECHs provide clear documentation for the end-user.

* **Informational RECH** -- Describes a REChain design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the REChain community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational RECHs do not necessarily represent REChain community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational RECHs or follow their advice.

* **Process RECH** -- Describes a process surrounding REChain, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process RECHs apply to areas other than the REChain protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to REChain's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational RECHs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in REChain development. Any meta-RECH is also considered a Process RECH.

## RECH status field

The RECH status field tracks the current state of the RECH.

### Specification

The status must be one of:

* **Draft** -- An initial state of a RECH before it is proposed to be accepted.
* **Proposed** -- A proposed RECH for community evaluation.
* **Active** -- A RECH that has been accepted and is currently being implemented or enforced.
* **Deferred** -- A RECH that is not being considered for immediate adoption.
* **Rejected** -- A RECH that is not going to be implemented. This may be due to technical flaws or community consensus against the proposal.
* **Withdrawn** -- A RECH that has been withdrawn by its author.
* **Final** -- A RECH that has been accepted and implemented successfully.
* **Replaced** -- A RECH that is no longer applicable because it has been replaced by a newer RECH.
* **Obsolete** -- A RECH that is no longer applicable because it has been rendered obsolete by subsequent developments.

### Rationale

The status field allows users and implementers to quickly understand the maturity and relevance of a RECH. The different status stages help guide the community's efforts in terms of review, discussion, and implementation.

## RECH comments

The RECH comments process is intended to promote community discussion and feedback. Comments should be posted in the designated section of the REChain Wiki for each RECH. This helps centralize feedback and maintain a clear history of discussions.

### Specification

Comments should be clearly associated with the relevant section of the RECH. The RECH author is responsible for addressing comments and updating the RECH as necessary. 

### Rationale

The comments process ensures that all relevant feedback is considered and helps improve the quality and clarity of RECHs. It also provides a record of the community's input and how it was addressed.

## RECH licensing

All RECHs must be licensed under terms that are compatible with REChain's open-source philosophy.

### Specification

RECHs should be licensed under one of the following categories:

#### Recommended licenses

- BSD-3-Clause
- Open Publication License (OPL)

#### Not recommended, but acceptable licenses

- CC-BY-SA-4.0

#### Not acceptable licenses

- Any license that imposes restrictions on the use, distribution, or modification of the RECH.

### Rationale

Licensing is a key consideration in ensuring that RECHs can be freely used, shared, and modified by the REChain community. The recommended licenses are chosen for their compatibility with open-source principles and the needs of the REChain community.
